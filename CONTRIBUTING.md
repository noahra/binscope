# Contributing to Byteblitz

We'd love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features

## We use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html) â€” all changes happen through pull requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the GNU GPL-3.0 License
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [GNU GPL-3.0 License](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/noahra/byteblitz/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/noahra/byteblitz/issues/new)

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code
[This is an example](http://stackoverflow.com/q/12488905/180626) of a good bug report. Try to include as much _relevant_ information as possible. 
Enable the verbose flag with `portal -v ...` and include the `.log`-file, if your bug can be reproduced.

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background.
- Steps to reproduce.
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen.
- What actually happens.
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work).

## Use a consistent coding style

- Use `cargo fmt`, easy!
- Try to follow the general code style of the project. Have a look around the different packages to get a good feel for it!
